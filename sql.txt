Confirm there are no recent successful logins
sql
Copy
-- Data source: rti_success_login_history   (RTI_dataSource)
SELECT event_date,
       login_username,
       ip
FROM rti.rti_success_login_history
WHERE account_id       = 5811184
  AND event_date       > NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
ORDER BY event_date DESC;
If this returns zero rows for the last few days, we know the user has never typed the correct credentials since the issue began.

2 . Verify user & account status
sql
Copy
-- Data source: core_estaleauser  (Aurora writer)
SELECT id,
       username,
       state,
       lastlogin_date,
       password_reset_datetime
FROM core_estaleauser
WHERE email = 'dj4.twlv@gmail.com';

-- Data source: iram_usership
SELECT state
FROM iram_usership
WHERE account_user_id = (‑‑ use id from first query ‑‑)
  AND irAccount_id    = 5811184;
We expect state = ACTIVE in both tables. Anything else would explain the lock‑out.

3 . Check for 2‑Factor / Auth verification errors
(Only needed if the account has 2FA enabled.)

sql
Copy
-- Data source: iram_authentication_verification_tracking
SELECT doe,
       success,
       failure_reason,
       contact_channel
FROM iram_authentication_verification_tracking
WHERE core_estaleauser_id = (‑‑ same id as above ‑‑)
  AND doe > NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
ORDER BY doe DESC;
If we see recent failure_reason values (e.g. INVALID_PASSCODE) that means they get past username+password but fail 2FA.

4 . Re‑run the failed‑login query after user tries again
Ask the CSM to have Debaron attempt one more login with the exact string “Dj4_12” (copy/paste if possible).
Immediately re‑query:

sql
Copy
SELECT event_date,
       login_username,
       failed_reason
FROM rti.rti_failed_login_history
WHERE login_username IN ('Dj4_12','DJ4:12')
  AND event_date > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
ORDER BY event_date DESC;
If the new row still shows NOT_FOUND we know the user is still entering the wrong username. If it flips to INVALID_PASSWORD we’ll ask for a password reset while on a live call/chat.

5 . Double‑check password‑reset e‑mail delivery
You already confirmed SendGrid shows delivered + opened, but if you need the raw log:

sql
Copy
Settings → Email Activity → search dj4.twlv@gmail.com
Status should show Delivered / Opened, no “Blocked” or “Bounced”.
(SendGrid UI is faster than querying our DB.)
