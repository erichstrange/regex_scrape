Hi Julije & team,

Quick recap from our last round of testing:

The irclickid cookie is present on happiestbaby.eu, but it vanishes the moment the shopper is redirected to happiestbaby-eu.myshopify.com, so EU orders fall back to “Unknown / Direct”.

Shopify’s own guidance confirms that cookies set on a custom storefront won’t carry over to the .myshopify.com checkout unless a pass-through mechanism is enabled.

Impact’s Shopify documentation shows a “Tracking Management” toggle (Online Store → Theme → App embeds) that injects the script which copies irclickid into the checkout so attribution can occur.

The same requirement is reiterated in our plugin’s consent-management article under Take action step 5.

It’s normal if the irclickid field doesn’t always show in Shopify’s Additional Details once the toggle is on—the order can still attribute correctly.

Question for you (puts the ball in your court):
Could you please confirm whether the “Tracking Management” toggle is currently enabled in your Shopify Theme > App Embeds panel?

Why we ask
Enabling that single switch should allow the plugin to move the click-ID into checkout even with your headless NextJS storefront, eliminating the cookie drop-off we’re seeing. Shopify itself requires either this toggle or a custom cart-attribute hand-off for headless builds.

Next steps once you confirm:

If the toggle isn’t enabled, please turn it on and let us know—no code changes needed. We’ll then run another test order with the one-time promo code you supplied.

If the toggle is already on, we’ll take Plan B: add a tiny cart-attribute script to write irclickid into the cart before checkout (Shopify’s Cart API allows this).

After either fix, we’ll rerun our vetted orders_vs_clicks_eu.sql report to verify that real orders now match to clicks.

Thanks in advance for confirming the toggle status—once we have that, we can move quickly to finalise attribution.
