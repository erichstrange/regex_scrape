This is the exact vetted template; only the publisherId token was replaced with 6300735.

What to look for

Result	Interpretation	Next step
≥ 1 row(s)	We found a live PENDING row. Check program_id.
• If it’s 32154 or 33578 → DB and UI are out of sync ⇒ escalate to Reporting (RPT).
• If it points to a retired / hidden program → orphaned → open Jira for AP (contracts) to patch.	
0 rows	No pending-contract record exists → the dashboard card is being fed only by the application table. Pull the raw application next (query #2 below).	

2 – If no row is found: verify the raw application

SELECT id,
       platform_application_date,
       application_status,
       iram_advertiser_id,
       iram_program_id
FROM   iram.iram_application
WHERE  iram_publisher_id  = 6300735
  AND  iram_advertiser_id = 6079287
ORDER BY platform_application_date DESC;
If this returns one record with application_status='IN_REVIEW' but the program is null or references an inactive program, that confirms the “ghost-program” theory.
