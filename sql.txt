3.1 List the 7 “Sell more with Shopify” ads as the brand sees them
sql
Copy
Edit
/* Active ads that carry the label on the advertiser side */
SELECT a.id              AS ad_id,
       a.name,
       a.state,
       al.label_name,
       a.last_updated    AS last_upd
FROM   irad_ad a
JOIN   irad_adlabel_map alm  ON alm.irad_ad_id = a.id
JOIN   irad_adlabel     al   ON al.id = alm.irad_adlabel_id
WHERE  a.state = 'ACTIVE'
  AND  al.label_name = 'Sell more with Shopify'
ORDER  BY ad_id;
Expected result: 7 rows (IDs will match the ones Nicholas mentioned).

3.2 Verify which partners should be able to see that label
sql
Copy
Edit
/* Partners indexed to the label */
SELECT DISTINCT pli.iram_publisher_id   AS partner_id
FROM   irad_partner_label_index pli
JOIN   irad_adlabel al ON al.id = pli.irad_adlabel_id
WHERE  al.label_name = 'Sell more with Shopify';
Expected result: exactly the three partner IDs Nicholas supplied.
If any partner is missing, the label indexer hasn’t run for them.

3.3 (Optional) Force-check one partner’s visibility mapping
Replace <PARTNER_ID>:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM   irad_partner_label_index pli
JOIN   irad_adlabel al  ON al.id = pli.irad_adlabel_id
WHERE  pli.iram_publisher_id = <PARTNER_ID>
  AND  al.label_name = 'Sell more with Shopify';
