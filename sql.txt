/* Pixel Order Processing Latency 
   Datasource: r_ds_singlestore

*/
Internal-only lookup for a single order action in action_fact.
Given advertiser, campaign, action ID, and a narrow action date range, returns conversion time, AP processed time, last adjustment time, and latency in minutes.

/* FTP Submission Log Lookup (Internal Only)
   Datasource: r_ds_ods

*/

Shows when FTP files were submitted to Impact (submit_date) so TS/CS can compare FTP submit timing with AP processing timing in the pixel latency report.

    AND batch_id = [[BATCH_ID]]
ORDER BY
    submit_date DESC
LIMIT 500;



/* API Submission Log Lookup (Internal Only)
   Datasource: r_ds_ods

*/
Shows when the API request was logged (doe) so TS/CS can compare API submission timing with AP processing timing in the pixel latency report.

SELECT
